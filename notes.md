# hist300-week5

## KoBoToolbox Form
Add text boxes for notes on unclear sections (Material, etching, font)

Limiting responses to m/c style answers provides a rigid response framework, not allowing specific and unique information to be categorized

Add skip logic to add questions that ask for specifics in regard to certain answers (i.e. if monument is damaged, add innformation about type of damage. If monument is undamaged, skip question about type of damage)

Override last - Further limitation is not what we need. Questions can just be left blank if they dont apply. Lets form be more transparent (Similar to issues with Google Scholar from HIST 2809)

Using question hints to reaffirm a formatting (ellipses for inscriptions)

Add multiple entries for "Additional Information"

Use questions hints more frequently to direct what type of information should be accounted for (i.e. 'Additional notes about monument dimensions' with hint 'Taper, angle, etc')

Make more questions answers in text form instead of numbers (Can add numbers via text answer but not vice versa)

**Found the DEBS form too limiting, not enough room for additional specific comments**
